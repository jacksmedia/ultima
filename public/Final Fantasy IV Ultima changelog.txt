******************************* Outdated Info *******************************

--- Description ---
21) Dark Knight Cecil now dual-wields and is 2-handed!!
27) Rare items and summons now drop much easier! This hack is designed as a 'play-through' without grinding.**
32) Useless finds now replaced with good items or equipment!
33) All weapons/armors used by characters no longer in party are now usable by at least one character from the end-game party!
34) MOST items/equipment are now non-missable. Meaning they will be acquirable in some ways at end-game. (not including unique ones such as Excalibur, etc. so don't throw those for 100% games!)
* Edge always felt a bit useless at end-game. I see the intent was for him to be a well-rounded, jack of all trades character but I think that fell short and the end result is he's really not that good in anything. I buffed him so he's now capable both physically and magically! He has new spells, new gears, and end-game steals have good items as opposed to useless junk in the vanilla version.
** More copies of endgame, OP and ULTRA rare items will still require grinding to acquire.

Other notes:
---------------------------------------------------------
As the vanilla version was a very easy game, here's what I did with this hack's difficulty:
-About 1/3 into the game, the difficulty starts to increase slightly from the vanilla game.
-At around the events after the Sealed Cave, the game's difficulty ramps up.
-Within the last dungeon, the game starts to become very challenging.
...
-(v5.30)After witnessing many players on streams having frustration at the last stretch of the game, I've added an extra save point plus you are no longer required to battle the AI again after the initial fight. Hope this helps alleviate some of the frustrations at endgame!
---------------------------------------------------------

Different Modes:
---------------------------------------------------------
-= Normal Mode =-
-----------------
-This is the intended version and difficulty of this hack by the devs.
-The Main Story parts of the game should be accessible to the general audience. The Optional and the Extra Endgame content, however, will see a spike in difficulty.

-= Novice Mode (does not apply to current versions) =-
-----------------
-99% of the Main Story parts of the game remain the same as Normal Mode. The only changes are the Required Bosses in the Lunar Subterrane/Core, including Zeromus. They have been nerf'd.
-All of the Optional and Endgame Super Bosses have been nerf'd! They are now much easier and the difficulty progression should be much more natural from the end of the Main Story game.
-Saves are 100% compatible and transferable between the Normal/Novice Modes. So, if at any point in the Normal Mode becomes too difficult or overwhelming, simply move your saves over to the Novice Mode and you'll be good to go!
-All other items, weapons, gears, spells and other aspects of the game remain the same as Normal Mode.
