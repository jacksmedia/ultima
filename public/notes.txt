It would be ideal to have more people learn how to actually make patches!

Either use STK to inject the PNG files,
OR copy paste changes made from the ff6tools imports to a clean Ultima rom,
then make a patch from that.

I write guides explaining how to do *exactly what I do*. You can learn to do it, too.
