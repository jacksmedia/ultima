   FINAL FANTASY IV - ULTIMA PLUS
     SQUISHBGONE v1.15 CHANGELOG
           by FlamePurge


CHANGES: Menu text related to items and spells, as well as pieces of dialogue that reference those items and spells.

EFFECT: Removes usage of most squish tiles (2-3+ letters shrunk together into 1-2+ letter's width, to circumvent letter limitations) through various means for a clean, appealing aesthetic. At times, this involved renaming items and spells. This was made sheerly due to the script supervisor's preference to, more or less, work within the original letter constraints the game was developed with.

CHANGELOG
---------
- v1.15   Compliant with FF4UP v1.09.


- v1.14   Compliant with FF4UP v1.08.
          Corrected reference of Magus (Sorcerer) class in dialogue for consistency.

- v1.13   Compliant with altered Training Room tutorials.

- v1.12   Compliant with restored Adamant Ring acquisition notice.

- v1.11   Main patch and font packs are now compliant with new wind-elemental icon.
          Elemental fangs' names adjusted.

- v1.09   Guard and Aegis description spill-overs fixed.

- v1.08   Fenix Esper and attack now use SquishBGone spellings when obtained from its side quest.

- v1.07   Initial release coinciding with FF4UP.


NAME DIFFERENCES

These were the used multi-letter tiles, or "squish tiles," originating from FF4 Ultima Plus.
