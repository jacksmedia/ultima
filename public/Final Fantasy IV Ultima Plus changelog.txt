Other Notes
-----------
As the vanilla version was a very easy game, here's what I did with this hack's difficulty:
-About 1/3 into the game, the difficulty starts to increase slightly from the vanilla game.
-Around the events after the Sealed Cave, the game's difficulty ramps up.
-Within the last dungeon, the game starts to become very challenging.
...
-(v5.30)After witnessing many players on streams having frustration at the last stretch of the game, I've added an extra save point. Plus, you are no longer required to battle the AI again after the initial fight. Hope this helps alleviate some of the frustrations at endgame!


Different Difficulties
----------------------
-= Standard Mode =-
------------------
-This is the intended version and difficulty of this hack by the devs.
-The Main Story parts of the game should be accessible to the general audience. The Optional and the Extra Endgame content, however, will see a spike in difficulty.

-= Reduced Mode =-
------------------
-99% of the Main Story parts of the game remain the same as Normal Mode. The only changes are the Required Bosses in the Lunar Subterrane/Core, including Zeromus. They have been nerf'd.
-All of the Optional and Endgame Super Bosses have been nerf'd! They are now much easier and the difficulty progression should be much more natural from the end of the Main Story game.
-Saves are 100% compatible and transferable between the Normal/Novice Modes. So, if at any point in the Normal Mode becomes too difficult or overwhelming, simply move your saves over to the Novice Mode and you'll be good to go!
-All other items, weapons, gears, spells and other aspects of the game remain the same as Normal Mode.
